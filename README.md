**Title:** Develop an admin dashboard with CSS Grid layout and dynamic theme switching.

## 3. Defined Approach
HTML is used to build the basic structure such as the sidebar, navigation menu, cards, and profile section.

CSS Grid helps place the sidebar and main content next to each other in a clean and responsive layout.

Flexbox is used inside sections like the sidebar menu and header to properly align icons and text.

Font Awesome icons are added to make the navigation items visually clear and user-friendly.

Hover effects are applied using CSS to give interactive feedback when the user moves the mouse over menu items or cards.

JavaScript is used to switch between light mode and dark mode by changing a theme value.

LocalStorage stores the selected theme so the user’s preference remains even after refreshing the page.

The profile picture is displayed at the bottom of the sidebar using an image tag.
